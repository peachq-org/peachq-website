# Foreign functions (FFI)

peachq calls C through the `.ffi` namespace. It is the KX ffikdb surface, spelling for spelling, over a vendored libffi:
`.ffi.bind`, `.ffi.callFunction`, `.ffi.cvar`, `.ffi.setErrno`, `.ffi.extension`, `.ffi.ptrsize` and `.ffi.os` all mean
what they mean there, so published ffikdb examples run unchanged.

## Loading

`.ffi` is part of the standard library, behind the one gate:

```q
q)\l pq
```

Before the gate the namespace does not exist, so a pre-gate environment stays kdb-clean.

## `bind` and `callFunction`

Both call C. The difference is *when* the work happens.

`.ffi.bind[funcname;argtypes;returntype]` resolves the symbol and builds the call interface **once**, then hands back a
function you can call as often as you like. Use it on anything hot.

```q
q)f:.ffi.bind[`libm.so.6`pow;"ff";"f"]
q)f(2f;10f;::)
1024f
```

`.ffi.callFunction[returnfunc;arglist]` does that work on **every** call, and takes the argument list directly. Use it
for a one-shot.

```q
q).ffi.callFunction[("f";`sqrt)] (16f;::)
4f
q).ffi.callFunction[("i";`abs)] (-7i;::)
7i
```

> **Warning: a bound function takes ONE list of arguments, and that list ends with `::`.**
> It is unary, so `f[2f;10f]` is `'rank`. So is `f(2f;10f)`, because same-type items collapse into a vector and the
> binding then sees one argument where it wanted two. Write `f(2f;10f;::)`. See
> [Argument lists and the `::` sentinel](#argument-lists-and-the-sentinel).

Two spellings name the function, and both `bind` and `callFunction` take them:

| spelling | meaning |
|---|---|
| `` `strlen `` | a symbol already resolvable in the running process |
| `` `libm.so.6`pow `` | an explicit library and symbol, the `dlopen` path |

A bare symbol resolves against the already-linked process, which is why `strlen`, `sprintf`, `qsort`, `getpid` and `pow`
need no library name here. Name the library explicitly for anything that is not already loaded.

`callFunction` and `cvar` accept a **third** spelling that `bind` does not: `("f";`sqrt)`, a return-type letter paired
with either of the rows above. They need it because they are told nothing else about types. `callFunction` infers the
argument types from the values you pass, and with a bare symbol the return letter defaults to `"i"`. `bind` is given
`returntype` as its own argument, so handing it the paired form instead is `'type`:

```q
q).ffi.bind[("f";`sqrt);"f";"f"]
'type
```

Being told all the types up front is what lets `bind` build the interface once.

### Argument lists and the `::` sentinel

A binding is unary: it takes a list of the C function's arguments, terminated by `::`. The three spellings that look
more natural all fail, and they all fail the same way:

| you write | what the binding receives | result |
|---|---|---|
| `f[2f;10f]` | two arguments | `'rank` |
| `f(2f;10f)` | one float **vector**, the list having collapsed | `'rank` |
| `f[(2f;10f)]` | the same collapsed vector | `'rank` |
| `f(2f;10f;::)` | a general list of two floats | `1024f` |

The middle two rows are not an FFI rule at all. They are ordinary q: same-type items written in a list collapse into a
*vector*.

```q
q)type (2f;10f)
9h
```

`9h` is a float vector, so it is **one** value of count 2, and `f(2f;10f)` hands the binding a single argument where it
wanted two. Adding `::` puts a non-float in the list, which stops the collapse and leaves a general list. The binding
drops the trailing `::` before marshalling. That is all the sentinel is for.

This also explains the call that *seems* to work by accident. A mixed list cannot collapse, so `f(1;2;"testing")` needs
no sentinel, right up until the day two of its arguments come to share a type.

The convention is KX's, not a peachq invention: every published ffikdb example is written `f (a;b;c;::)`. The same
collapse rule bites character data in [`regexp.md`](regexp.md#the-collapse-trap), for the same reason.

peachq also accepts the call **without** the sentinel when the bound arity already says how many arguments there are and
the values cannot collapse into one:

```q
q)strlen:.ffi.bind[`strlen;"C";"i"]
q)strlen "12345"
5i
```

**That is a superset, not KX behaviour.** Write the `::` anyway: it is the spelling that is correct on both, and the
only one whose meaning does not change the moment two arguments come to share a type.

## Type characters

One letter per argument, one for the return. The letters describe the *C prototype*; the values marshal from the actual
q arguments.

| letter | C type | q value |
|---|---|---|
| `b` | `unsigned char` (0/1) | boolean |
| `c` | `char` | char |
| `x`, `g` | `unsigned char` | byte |
| `h` | `short` | short |
| `i` | `int` | int |
| `j` | `long long` | long |
| `l` | `size_t` | long |
| `e` | `float` | real |
| `f` | `double` | float |
| `s` | `char *` | symbol |
| `m` `d` `u` `v` `t` | `int` | month, date, minute, second, time |
| `p` `n` | `long long` | timestamp, timespan |
| `z` | `double` | datetime |
| `r` | a raw pointer, passed as the address itself | int or long |
| `k` | a callback (see [Callbacks](#callbacks)) | a `(function;"argtypes";"returntype")` tuple |
| `" "` (space) | `void` | return only; the call answers `::` |
| **uppercase** | **pointer to that type** | dereferenced on return |

```q
q)lround:.ffi.bind[`lround;"f";"j"]
q)lround (2.6;::)
3
q)labs:.ffi.bind[`labs;"j";"j"]
q)labs (-7;::)
7
```

An empty `argtypes` is a zero-argument function. It still takes an argument list; the list is just the sentinel alone:

```q
q)b0:.ffi.bind[`getpid;"";"i"]
q).z.i=b0 (::)
1b
```

## Pointers

An uppercase letter is a pointer to the lowercase type. On return the pointer is dereferenced, and `C`, a NUL-terminated
`char *`, comes back as a string:

```q
q)sr:.ffi.bind[`strerror;"i";"C"]
q)sr (2i;::)
"No such file or directory"
```

A NULL pointer answers the typed null for its letter rather than crashing.

**A numeric vector crosses as an in-place data pointer**, so anything C writes through it is visible in q immediately.
That is how out-parameters work:

```q
q)p:-1 -1i
q).ffi.callFunction[("i";`pipe)] (p;::)
0i
q)all p>=0
1b
q)(.ffi.callFunction[("i";`close)] (p 0;::)),.ffi.callFunction[("i";`close)] (p 1;::)
0 0i
```

Character vectors are the one place peachq diverges, as a compatible superset: a char vector is **auto-NUL-terminated
through a copy** unless it already ends in an explicit `"\000"`. Only the explicit tail keeps the in-place contract,
which is exactly why an output buffer is built with one:

```q
q)x:80#"\000"
q)n:.ffi.callFunction[("i";`sprintf)] (x;"%s %f %hd\000";"test\000";2f;0h;::)
q)n
15i
q)"test 2.000000 0"~x til "j"$n
1b
```

A symbol atom marshals as `char *`. A symbol *vector* is different again: it crosses as a `char *[]` of copied strings,
and what comes back is the **permutation** C left them in, which is what makes sorting one from C work:

```q
q)s:`c`a`b
q).ffi.callFunction[(" ";`qsort)] (s;`int$count s;.ffi.ptrsize[];({(x>y)-x<y};"SS";"i");::)
q)s
`a`b`c
```

The `r` letter takes an address you already hold as an int or long, for the case where a C function hands you an opaque
handle to give back later.

### The letter has to match the elements

An uppercase letter is a pointer to a vector of **that** type, and `bind` enforces it: the letter is the only thing that
can, because in the call interface `I`, `J` and `F` are all just "a pointer".

```q
q)ti:.ffi.bind[`libqr.so`take_ints;"Ii";" "]
q)ti (1 2 3 4;4i;::)
'type
q)ti (1 2 3 4i;4i;::)
```

The long vector is `'type` because the C function reads `int`s: unchecked, it would have read the 32-byte long vector
four bytes at a time and printed `1 0 2 0`. The same check catches the dangerous direction — an `int` vector under `"J"`,
where a C function writing `long long`s writes 16 bytes past the end of the q object, silently.

What is checked is the **C type** the letter names, not the q type. The table above gives `i` `m` `d` `u` `v` `t` one C
type between them, so a date vector satisfies `"I"` exactly as it satisfies `"D"` — both are `int *`, and the C function
cannot tell them apart. The same goes for `"J"` over a timestamp and `"F"` over a datetime.

`R` and `K` are exempt: a raw address and a callback have no element type to check. Lowercase letters are exempt too,
which is what keeps the `qsort` binding above working — it passes an int vector under `"l"`, and a `count` is a long
atom under `"i"`.

`C` accepts a string or a symbol atom, both of which are a `char *`. `S` wants a symbol **vector**, because it is a
`char *[]`.

`.ffi.callFunction` cannot make this check and never will. It is told no letters for its arguments — it infers the whole
call interface from the values you pass — so there is no declaration to compare them against:

```q
q).ffi.callFunction[(" ";`libqr.so`take_ints)] (1 2 3 4;::)   / no letters, no check: C sees 1 0 2 0
```

Prefer `bind` for anything that takes a pointer, and if you do reach for `callFunction`, type its vectors explicitly
(`1 2 3 4i`, not `1 2 3 4`).

## Callbacks

A q function crosses to C as a function pointer under the `k` letter. You pass it as the tuple
`(function;"argtypes";"returntype")`, where the argument letters describe what **C** will call it with:

```q
q)cmp:{(x>y)-x<y}
q)qs:.ffi.bind[`qsort;"liik";" "]
q)u:5 4 1 3 2i
q)qs (u;`int$count u;4i;(cmp;"II";"i");::)
q)u
1 2 3 4 5i
```

`"II"` because `qsort` hands its comparator two `const void *` that point at ints, and `"i"` because it wants an int
back. A callback may itself make foreign calls; re-entering is fine.

### When a callback fails

This part is **peachq's, beyond KX**, and it is deliberate. A q error inside a callback does not longjmp through C. It
*parks*: this invocation and every later one inside the same foreign call return neutral zero results, the foreign call
completes normally, and the parked error then propagates as the q result of the call.

```q
q)qs (u;`int$count u;4i;({[x;y] '"kaboom"};"II";"i");::)
'kaboom
q)2+2
4
```

The evaluator is healthy afterwards, the vector keeps its shape, and the same binding works again. A callback returning
something that will not convert is `'type` rather than a silently faked zero:

```q
q)qs (u;`int$count u;4i;({[x;y]`abc};"II";"i");::)
'type
```

Closures, like bindings, live until the process exits, which is KX parity.

## `cvar`, reading a C global

`.ffi.cvar` takes the same shape `callFunction` takes for its function, and reads a variable instead of calling
anything:

```q
q)0<.ffi.cvar ("r";`stdout)
1b
```

## `setErrno`

Sets `errno` and returns its **previous** value. Called with no argument it only reads:

```q
q){.ffi.setErrno 7i; .ffi.setErrno[]} []
7i
```

## Platform and environment

These three report the host. They do **not** all return the same kind of thing:

| function | example | type |
|---|---|---|
| `.ffi.extension[]` | `` `so `` / `` `dll `` / `` `dylib `` | symbol, `-11h` |
| `.ffi.os[]` | `"l"` / `"w"` / `"m"` | **char**, `-10h` |
| `.ffi.ptrsize[]` | `8i` / `4i` | int, `-6h` |

```q
q).ffi.extension[]
`so
q).ffi.os[]
"l"
q).ffi.ptrsize[]
8i
q)type .ffi.extension[]
-11h
q)type .ffi.os[]
-10h
q)type .ffi.ptrsize[]
-6h
```

`.ffi.extension` returns a symbol, which is what `` ` sv `` joins, so building a platform-correct library name works:

```q
q)` sv `qr,.ffi.extension[]
`qr.so
```

The same idiom with `.ffi.os` does not, because a char is not a symbol:

```q
q)` sv `qr,.ffi.os[]
'type
```

Both return types are KX's, kept deliberately. `.ffi.os` is `{[] first string .z.o}` verbatim, and published examples
branch on it with `"l"=.ffi.os[]`, which would itself be `'type` against a symbol. If you want the OS letter *in* a
symbol, convert it: `` `$ "qr", .ffi.os[] ``.

## Errors

peachq answers bare q error classes here. KX embeds a message string in the error text; we do not, which is a recorded
divergence. The class is the contract.

| error | means |
|---|---|
| `'os` | the symbol did not resolve: wrong name, or the library is not loaded |
| `'type` | a type letter outside the table, a malformed function spelling, a value that will not convert, or an argument whose element type does not match its uppercase letter |
| `'rank` | the argument list is the wrong length, which is where the collapse trap lands |
| `'limit` | `callFunction` was given more than 32 arguments (`bind` answers `'type` for more than 32 letters) |
| `'nyi` | this build has no libffi |

```q
q).ffi.bind[`no_such_fn_xyz;"";" "]
'os
q).ffi.bind[`strlen;"q";"i"]
'type
q)strlen ("a\000";"b\000";::)
'rank
```

The vendored libffi links on Linux x86-64 and its Windows cross-build only. Everywhere else, meaning macOS and the
WebAssembly browser build, `.ffi` loads but every call answers `'nyi`. That is the one meaning of `'nyi` here: the
build, never the arguments.

## Compatibility with ffikdb

| | |
|---|---|
| **Matches KX** | every public spelling; the one-argument-list calling convention and the `::` sentinel; the type letters; uppercase-is-a-pointer; numeric vectors crossing as in-place data pointers, and symbol vectors as a copied `char *[]` with the permutation written back; bindings and closures living until exit; `.ffi.extension` byte for byte |
| **Superset** | the `::` may be omitted when the bound arity disambiguates and the arguments cannot collapse; char vectors auto-NUL-terminate through a copy unless an explicit `"\000"` tail is present; a q error inside a callback parks and propagates rather than longjmping; errors are bare classes with no embedded message |
| **Narrower** | a bound uppercase letter must match the C type of the argument's elements, and a non-vector under one (other than `::`) is `'type`. KX accepts the mismatch and reads or writes at the wrong stride — see [The letter has to match the elements](#the-letter-has-to-match-the-elements) |

Nothing in the superset column changes the meaning of code written to the KX rules. If you write ffikdb-portable q, with
the sentinel always and explicit NUL tails on buffers, it runs identically here. The narrower row is the one place we
reject what KX accepts, and only where KX's own table already says uppercase means a vector of the same type.
