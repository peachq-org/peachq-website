A q function signature has always told you how many arguments a function takes and what they
are called. In peachq it can also tell you their **types**, which of them are **optional**,
what their **defaults** are, and whether the function accepts **extra arguments**, and it
tells you all of that from the text of the signature alone, without running anything.

```q
q)quote:{[sym:`s;size:`j=100;price:`f=0n] (sym;size;price)}
q)quote[`IBM]
`IBM
100
0n
```

That signature is a complete description of how to call `quote`. You do not have to read the
body, and neither does your editor.

## Why peachq supports a subset, and why that is the point

The wider **pattern matching** family covers list and dictionary destructuring, constant
patterns, a pattern conditional, and **filter functions**, where a parameter annotation is an
arbitrary q function that is *called* on the argument every time the function runs.

peachq implements one part of that deliberately: the **type-check pattern**, plus two extensions
of its own (defaults and varargs) built to the same standard. The standard is:

> **Everything in a signature is a literal or a type name. Nothing in a signature is code.**

That single rule is what makes the whole feature useful to tools:

- **A linter can check your call sites.** Argument counts, argument types, unknown parameter
  names and missing required arguments are all decidable by reading two pieces of text, the
  signature and the call, with no evaluation and no execution risk.
- **An editor can complete and document as you type**, because the parameter list is data, not
  a program whose meaning depends on the state of the process.
- **Errors arrive early.** A malformed or self-contradictory signature is reported when the
  file loads, not on the unlucky code path six months later.
- **A signature is honest to anyone reading it**: a colleague, a reviewer, a code-generation
  tool, or a model. There is no hidden behaviour to discover by running it.

A filter function can express things a type name cannot, such as "a long between 0 and 100" or "a
non-empty table". peachq asks you to write those on the first line of the body instead, where
they read as what they are: validation logic. The signature stays a description.

## Type checks

Annotate a parameter with `:` and a type symbol.

```q
q)f:{[x:`j;y:`j] x+y}
q)f[1;2]
3
q)f[1f;2]
'type
```

Type checking is **exact**. A float is not accepted where a long is declared, and a long is not
accepted where a float is declared: there is no automatic widening. If you want a float
parameter, pass a float:

```q
q)price:{[p:`f] p*2}
q)price 42
'type
q)price 42f
84f
```

### Atoms and lists

**Lowercase means an atom and uppercase means a list**:

```q
q)atom:{[x:`j] x}
q)atom 5
5
q)atom 1 2 3
'type

q)vec:{[x:`J] sum x}
q)vec 1 2 3
6
q)vec 5
'type
```

This is worth understanding before you annotate: **an annotation narrows a function.** An
unannotated q function often works on both atoms and vectors, and declaring `` `j `` gives that
up.

```q
q)plus:{[x;y] x+y}
q)plus[1 2 3;4]
5 6 7

q)tplus:{[x:`j;y:`j] x+y}
q)tplus[1 2 3;4]
'type
```

Iterators are unaffected, because they pass atoms:

```q
q)tplus[;1] each 1 2 3
2 3 4
```

Annotate where you want the narrowing: boundaries, public entry points, anything called from
somewhere you cannot see. Leave general-purpose internal functions unannotated.

### Type symbols

The type character is the standard one, lowercase for an atom and uppercase for a list:

| symbol | type | | symbol | type | | symbol | type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `` `b `` | boolean | | `` `e `` | real | | `` `d `` | date |
| `` `g `` | guid | | `` `f `` | float | | `` `z `` | datetime |
| `` `x `` | byte | | `` `c `` | char | | `` `n `` | timespan |
| `` `h `` | short | | `` `s `` | symbol | | `` `u `` | minute |
| `` `i `` | int | | `` `p `` | timestamp | | `` `v `` | second |
| `` `j `` | long | | `` `m `` | month | | `` `t `` | time |

There is no character for a table, a dictionary, a general list or a function, so those
parameters go unannotated for now. Longer type names are a planned extension; until they
arrive, annotate what you can name and leave the rest.

## Defaults

A default makes a parameter optional. Write it with `=`, the same way TypeScript does:

```q
q)g:{[x;y=10] x+y}
q)g 1
11
q)g[1;2]
3
```

Defaults combine with types, and the default must satisfy the type it is declared against:
a signature that contradicts itself is rejected when the function is defined, not when it is
called:

```q
q)f2d:{[x:`j;y:`j=10] x+y}
q)f2d 5
15
q)f2d[5;20]
25
```

**Defaults are literals**: atoms, homogeneous vector literals, and `()`. They are not
expressions, and they cannot refer to other parameters.

```q
q)f:{[x;y=1 2 3] y}      / fine
q)f:{[x;y=x*2] y}        / 'parse
q)f:{[x;y=count x] y}    / 'parse
q)f:{[x;y=1+2] y}        / 'parse, a literal is a literal, not a computation
```

This is the rule that lets a tool report a function's defaults without running your code.

**Passing a null is not the same as omitting an argument.** Omission takes the default; an
explicit null is a value you chose:

```q
q)n:{[x=10] x}
q)n[]
10
q)n[0N]
0N
```

Required parameters must come before defaulted ones, which must come before a rest parameter.
`{[x=1;y] … }` is rejected, because `f[5]` would be ambiguous.

## Varargs

A rest parameter, written `...name`, collects any extra arguments into a list. It must be last,
there can only be one, and it takes no default. It may be typed, in which case every collected
argument is checked.

```q
q)fv:{[...x] x}
q)fv[]
()
q)fv[1;2;3]
1 2 3

q)f2v:{[x;y;...z] (x;y;z)}
q)f2v[1;2;3;4]
1
2
3 4
```

A single collected argument is a one-item list, not an atom:

```q
q)f2v[1;2;3]
1
2
,3
```

## Optional arguments and projection

q projects when you supply too few arguments, and that does not change:

```q
q)add:{[x;y] x+y}
q)add[1]
{[x;y]x+y}[1;]
```

Once a function has defaults, an omitted argument has an obvious meaning, so it is used:

```q
q)g 1
11
```

The rule that reconciles the two is short:

> **An explicit hole projects. An absent argument defaults.**

```q
q)p:g[1;]     / a hole: still a projection
q)p 5
6
q)p[]         / applied with nothing: now the default fills
11
```

A function with no defaults and no rest parameter behaves exactly as it always has.

## Named apply

`.[f;dict]` binds dictionary keys to parameter names. Order does not matter, and you can supply
any subset of the arguments as long as the required ones are present.

```q
q)quote:{[sym:`s;size:`j=100;price:`f=0n] (sym;size;price)}

q).[quote;`sym!enlist `IBM]
`IBM
100
0n

q).[quote;`price`sym!(42.5;`IBM)]
`IBM
100
42.5
```

Positional apply is unchanged, and a dictionary you want to pass *as an argument* is enlisted
exactly as before:

```q
q).[quote;(`IBM;500;42.5)]     / positional, as always
`IBM
500
42.5

q)d:`a`b!10 20
q)fd:{[d] d`a+d`b}
q).[fd;enlist d]               / d as one argument
30
```

Unknown and missing names are reported rather than guessed:

```q
q)f:{[x;y=10] x+y}
q).[f;`x`z!1 2]
'param
q).[f;`y!enlist 2]
'param
```

The rest parameter can be bound by name, and its value must be a list, since it becomes the rest
list as given:

```q
q)f1v:{[x;y=10;...rest] (x;y;rest)}
q).[f1v;`x`rest!(1;(30;40))]
1
10
30 40
```

## Errors

| you get | when |
|---|---|
| `'parse` | the signature itself is not valid, reported when the function is **defined** |
| `'type` | an argument does not match its declared type |
| `'param` | an unknown or missing parameter name in a named apply |
| `'rank` | too many arguments, and no rest parameter |

The first row is the one that matters for tooling: **every signature mistake is a load-time
error.** A bad type character, a computed default, a required parameter after an optional one,
two rest parameters: none of these can reach production, because the file will not load.

## Not supported, on purpose

| not supported | write this instead |
|---|---|
| filter functions, ``{[x:tempCheck] … }`` | validate on the first line of the body |
| computed defaults, `{[x;y=x*2] … }` | compute in the body when the argument is absent |
| destructuring, `{[(a;b);c] … }` | take the list and index it |
| identifier types, `{[x:long] … }`, `{[c:int|long] … }` | use the type symbol, `` `j `` |

Each of these is rejected because it would put code, or a name that could mean anything, into a
signature, and the signature is the part we promise you can read without running.

The identifier form is worth calling out: `int|long` is a perfectly good q *expression*, so
accepting it in a type position would mean you could no longer tell a type from a variable by
looking. peachq keeps the type position to symbols so that never becomes a question.

## Planned

These are reserved: they are errors today so they can be added later without changing the
meaning of any code you write now:

```q
{[x:`j`J] … }      / unions
{[x:`long] … }     / long type names, with `LONG for the list form
{[x:`number] … }   / built-in type aliases
```

Type aliases will be defined by peachq, not by users, since an alias you would have to look up in
someone's source is exactly the thing this feature exists to avoid.

## Portability

Type checks are **standard q syntax**. A function annotated with types and nothing else runs
unchanged on any q that supports them, and can be sent to such a process over IPC:

```q
q)portable:{[x:`j;y:`f] x*y}
```

Defaults, varargs and named apply are peachq extensions. A q without them will not parse
them, so a function using them cannot be forwarded to such a process.

If you maintain code that must run on both, the line is per feature, not per file: annotate
types freely, and keep defaults, varargs and named apply out of the shared parts.
